# Cartographer App

The Cartographer App is used to provide placement information of zones of interest
in (historical) documents. The first and foremost use case is the identification
of bounding boxes of measures in music documents. It is a successor of the
*Vertaktoid*, but other than that uses web technology and is thus platform
independent. It optionally uses the *Measure Detector* for automatic recognition
of measure positions, but allows manual correction of these results.
